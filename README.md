# Regression-Boston-dataset
Learning to apply the machine learning basics of regression on the Boston Dataset.
Here we will apply the Multiple Linear regression for all the available features and see the resulting ROOTMEANSQUARE error.
we will then reduce the features not so important by the BACKWARD ELIMINATION method and check the RMSE value again!!
